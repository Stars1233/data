# Installation

::: tip üí° *Warp***Drive** simplifies distribution using npm channel tags
- `@lts` | `@latest` | `@beta` | `@canary`
:::

To use ***Warp*Drive**, you will install `@warp-drive/core`, a cache[^1], and a reactivity system such as [emberjs](#ember), [TC39 Signals](#tc39-signals) or even [react](#react).

[^1]: We recommend using `@warp-drive/json-api` as your cache even if your API is not [{json:api}](https://jsonapi.org).

:::

Complete your installation by installing and configuring the reactive framework of your choosing.

### Available Frameworks

- [ember](#ember)
- [react](#react)
- [svelte](#svelte) (üöß Coming Soon)
- [vue](#vue) (üöß Coming Soon)
- [TC39 Signals](#tc39-signals)

Don't see your framework listed yet? Reactive frameworks can typically be implemented in 15-30 lines of JS (before you add docs and types of course ;)). We're happy to add support for any framework that supports fine-grained signals based reactivity.

## Lockstep Versioning

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
We find this means its best to use exact versions instead of ranges as all WarpDrive packages should be upgraded together at once.
:::

*Warp***Drive** packages follow a lockstep versioning approach: all dependencies and peer-dependencies between the project's own packages are version-locked at the time of publish.

For instance, `@warp-drive/utilities@5.6.0` has a peer-dependency on `@warp-drive/core@5.6.0`. If any other
version were present (even a differing patch version such as `5.6.1`) it would create a conflict. All of the installation commands listed in this guide pin the version for this reason.


## Other Packages

*Warp***Drive** offers additional packages for features that don't quite meet the bar for being included
in core, or have been deprecated and removed from the core experience.

- `@warp-drive/utilities` provides commonly needed request builder, handler and string utils.
- `@warp-drive/experiments` provides bleeding edge unstable features we're prototyping like SharedWorker and PersistedCache
- `@warp-drive/legacy` provides extended life-support for features that have been removed from core.

Configure your app to use Ember's signals implementation by adding the following
import to the top of your application and test setup.

::: code-group

```ts [app/app.ts]
import '@warp-drive/ember/install';
```

```ts [tests/test-helper.ts]
import '@warp-drive/ember/install';

:::

Addons that make use of *Warp***Drive** should only do the above installation in their tests (including test apps)
but not in any published library code.

:::

Even though React does not natively understand signals, *Warp***Drive** provides a solution that
enables React to understand when reactive data used by a component has changed enabling it
to properly rerender. We'll cover this more in the [@warp-drive/react documentation](/api/@warp-drive/react)

Configure your app to use our React compatible signals implementation by adding the following
import to the top of your application. If you have tests which do not invoke your app, your
test setup should also have this import.

::: code-group

```ts [src/app.ts]
import '@warp-drive/react/install';
```

```ts [src/setupTests.ts]
import '@warp-drive/react/install';
```

:::

Only apps need to do the installation above, libraries providing React components that make use of *Warp***Drive**
should only do the above installation in their tests but not in any published library code.
